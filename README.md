# PhraseFrequencyAnalysis

Usage: python3 PhraseFreqAnalysis.py [Input text file] [length of phrase, e.g. 3]

Taking as input a basic text file, analyze frequency of ordered phrases (ranked based on number of words per phrase), i.e. most common 3 word phrase

Future development suggestions:

1) Send output to file instead of to console for more flexibility

2) Add HTML parsing for analyzing displayed text on webpages

3) Add comparison option/parameter for arbitrary phrase length comparisons, ex. compare the most common 3-word phrase against most common 4-word phrase, in the same file

4) Add comparison functionality between files, ie. most common 3-word phrases from each of two (or more files)

5) Combine features (2) and (3): Advanced interfile comparisons

6) Advanced linguistic parsing to ignore extremely common words, ex. "the", "a", "it's", to allow for more advanced farming of significant phrases
